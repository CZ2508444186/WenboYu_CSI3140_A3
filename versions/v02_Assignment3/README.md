## Introduction
This repository documents the design system for my Yatzy game website. This game is a single-player Yatzy game completely in PHP & HTML/JS/CSS. The game will enforce the rules of Yatzy, will manage the game state (current score, current role, etc) and will notify the user of the final score when the game is done.
Students enhanced their Yatzy game to have a PHP server component for managing the scoring by using AJAX to communicate between the HTML/CSS/JS client with the PHP server.

## Usage
1. Put file: v02_Assignment3 into IDE Phpstorm project, and run public/yatzy.html to play the game.
